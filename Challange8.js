// Coding Challenge #8 | JavaScript ðŸ”¥ | Lecture 047
// Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
// 2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
// 3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

// Test data: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
// Hints: Call â€˜calcTip â€˜in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays ðŸ˜‰

// Bonus:
// 4. Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
// 4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together.
// 4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).
// 4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array.

// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

const bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
const calcTip = (bill) => {
  // return 50 <= bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
  //   In JavaScript, the 50 <= bill <= 300 expression does not behave as expected. The reason is that in JavaScript, the <= operator is left-associative, meaning it is evaluated from left to right.

  // So, the expression 50 <= bill <= 300 is treated as (50 <= bill) <= 300. The result of the first comparison, (50 <= bill), will be either true or false, and then it's compared to 300. This doesn't correctly check whether bill is between 50 and 300.
  return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
};
const calcTotal = (bill, tip) => {
  return bill + tip;
};
const total = [];
const tip = [];
for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
  // tip.push(bills[i]);
  tip.push(calcTip(bills[i]));
  total.push(calcTotal(bills[i], calcTip(bills[i])));
}
console.log(tip);
console.log(total);

//

const calcAverage = (total, length) => {
  return total / length;
};
let sum = 0;
let average = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
  sum = sum + bills[i];
  // console.log(bills[i]);
  average = calcAverage(sum, bills.length);
  console.log(average);
}
console.log(sum);
console.log(average);
console.log("object");
